# Open Library Browser exercise for GOFORE recruiting

## Your resources

Open Library offers an API where you can get information on books and other documents. The full API documentation can be found at:

https://openlibrary.org/developers/api

You can do searches using GET requests such as:

http://openlibrary.org/search.json?title=<BOOK TITLE>

In the response, you will find an array of "docs". Most docs contain a "cover_i" attribute, which is an id for the book cover.

You can then fetch the covers with calls such as

http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/<COVER ID>-S.jpg - for thumbnails
http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/<COVER ID>-L.jpg - for large images

## Your task

Your task is to develop a book browser that complies with the following requirements:

- It should contain a search box where the user can input a book title, in full or partially.
- It should make use of the Open Library api.
- It should display a scrollable grid of the first 100 books, with the book cover thumbnail, book title and author.
- The book browser layout should be responsive, fully usable in both in desktop and mobile.

Desirable, but not mandatory requirements:

- When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the application should open the full-sized cover image in a modal. The user should then be able to return to the grid.
- Pagination of results showing either 10, 20, or 50 entries per page, to be chosen by the user.
- A switch that allows the user to toggle between the grid view and a detailed list view. The list should then display book cover thumbnail, book title, author, first publication year, ISBN (first value in the array).

## Evaluation

You'll be evaluated on:

- usability
- responsiveness
- performance
- code readability
- project structure

Also remember:

- Please include instructions on how to build and host the application.
- Please commit and push to the repository in the same way you would on any regular professional project.
- There's no strict deadline for this assignment. However, please keep track of your hours and mention them when you submit your assignment.
