## Instructions

Install node, I recommend to use Scoop (Windows), Homebrew (MacOS), Aptitude (Linux distro)

Run this command in your terminal to install dependencies: 
```sh
npm install
```
In order to launch the app you can type one of this commands:
```sh
npm start 
```
(to launch a local server and check the app, once started you can access typing "localhost:4200" in your browser)
or
```sh
npm run start:mobile 
```
(to launch a server than can be accessed by other computers/tablets/phones that share the same network, it's useful to check the responsiveness of the app, once started you can access typing "<PrivateIpServerComputer>:4200" in your computer/tablet/phone browser, as an example i'm using 192.168.1.134:4200)

Dependencies:
ngx-bootstrap, ngx-pagination, ngx-loading

I have spent around 10 hours working in this project.
